                <h3>Our Organisation</h3>
                <p>Vivekananda Kendra (VK) is a spiritually oriented service mission founded on 7th January 1972 by Sri Eknathji Ranade in Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu. Inspired by the centenary of Swami Vivekananda's historic address at Chicago in 1893, Eknathji conceived of an organisation that would carry forward Vivekananda's message through dedicated "man-making."</p>
                <p style="margin-top:12px;">The Kendra's activities span across education (running schools in remote areas), natural resource development, cultural activities, and youth leadership development. Its volunteers are committed workers who have dedicated their lives to national reconstruction.</p>
